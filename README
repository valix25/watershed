Building & Running the program:
1. cd to build folder
2. $ cmake ..
3. $ make
4. Next to see command line options:
   $ ./Moments -h
5. 2 Major options:
   $ ./Moments -i a1.png
   creates the a1_FeatureVectors in output folder
   $ ./Moments -l imagesList -m 3
   this would create the hu moments table and the image from the distance matrix.
   other arguments for -m are 0 for image moments, 1 for central moments and 2 for scaled moments. At any time you can run -h to see the options again.

Note for the distance matrix image:
1. max and min were computed from the distance matrix
2. scaled each value from distance matrix to [0,1]
   (dist_mat_entry - min) / (max - min)
3. scaled it to [0,255]
   (dist_mat_entry - min)*255.0 / (max - min)
4. take the floor of the value and is going to be the gray value in the image
5. As a result darker shades should show little error, or close values in the distance matrices of the compared images, in contrast lighter shades would high differences in the distance matrices.
